# Pixel-measuring
A small tool to measure two points of an image to return the distance of the two points. This can be used to identify similar objects or symbols within an image. 

Based on Python openCV image recognition.
Need to impliment a GUI(Working on that)
I've used matplotlib to plot the image. and to zoom into the image you can press "u". have to select the symbol that needs to be measured, a square needs to be drawn and then press enter.
it will start measuring
